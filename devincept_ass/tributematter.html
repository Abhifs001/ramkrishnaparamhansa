            <h2 id="headline">Here's a glance of Swami Ramakrishna Paramahansa's life </h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Birth and childhood:</strong>Bestowed to the Earth on 18 Feb 1836, Ramakrishna Paramhansa(orignal name-Gadadhar Chattopadhaya), belonged to a pious Bengali-Brahmin Family. <br>
                Right from the beginning, he was fascinated by the spiritualim and the associated ecstasies. Adwait Vedanta, Tantra, Vaishnava Bhakti etc were the only topics of his brainstorming Although Ramakrishna attended a village school with some regularity for 12 years, he later rejected the traditional schooling saying that he was not interested in a "bread-winning education <br> <br>
                </li>
            <li> <strong>At Dakshineshwar Kali Temple:</strong> Spending Hours in crying for lord Kali, he was priest at a temple built by Rani Rashmoni, a wealthy female zamindar </li> <br> 
            <li><strong>First sight of the lord kali:</strong>Meditating exrtensively in front of lord Kali, he used to repeatedly call the mother of universe to let him get the first glance of the holy power of the mother of the universe.
                when he got the very first sight of the lord kali, he became overwhelmed with the supreme consciousnesss and the <i>feeling of being</i>
            </li> <br>
            <li> <strong>Marriage:</strong> <i><u>How one will respond on asking about one's married life?</u></i> Just think once!! <br> Surely, he will feel shy or shout at you. <br> But, if you search about the Swami ji's married life, you will find ample of articles <br>Yes!! He worshipped his own wife like his own Mother <br>
            What else is remaining now. Nothing can be holy and greater than this <br>People continously run behind girls, money, power. But, a few think about the supreme power who bestows all of this </li> <br>
            <li> <strong>With Swami Vivekananda:</strong>Every great leader has a mentor, who guides him to traverse the peak-greatness. Swami Vivekananda, who led the youth with his great spiritual teachings was a disciple of Swami Ramkrishna Paramhansa. <br>
            <strong><i><u>Every man aspires a son who can hold all his assets, but no one think completely impartially as Swami Ramkrishna Paramahansa, who gave all his assets to Narendra Naath, who was extremely eager to the self-realisation. He later became Swami Vivekananda and enlightened the world with the knowledge of Vedanta and spiritualism</u></i></strong></li> <br>
            <li><strong>In the last days:</strong>In his last days he was looked after by his disciples. Despite the doctor's advice to keep the silence, he used to converse with the Devotees. As a result, his throat cancer got worse and he took his last breath during the early hours of 16 Aug 1886.</li>
